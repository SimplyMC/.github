# Welcome to SimplyMC!

SimplyMC is a friendly minecraft community dedicated to bringing an experience as close to vanilla as possible.  
Feel free to join the [Discord!](https://discord.com/invite/DZyknsSNJp)

This Github organisation will be the place for anything and everything that we open source.  
This will include some of the useful plugins we've custom made for our servers as well as other projects related to our community.

Most if not everything we put here will be licensed under the very permissive MIT license, so really you can do whatever you want with it, whether that's use it for yourself or just take inspiration from it.

(Please note, not every repository may have a license, double check that the code you use is MIT licensed. If you want use to license something, open an issue.)
