# Welcome to SimplyMC!

## Who are we?

SimplyMC is a friendly minecraft community dedicated to bringing an experience as close to vanilla as possible whilst remaining grief-free.  
We do this by keeping our server whitelisted as well as running CoreProtect on the server, the only plugin players will notice is there.  
Feel free to join the [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/DZyknsSNJp) for more info!

## What is this?

This Github organisation will be the place for anything and everything that we open source.  
This will include some of the useful plugins we've custom made for our servers as well as other projects related to our community.

### Licensing

Most if not everything we put here will be licensed under the very permissive MIT license because we want you to be able to use it yourself or take inspiration from it.

**Caution**  
Licensing is still done per repository, check the license in the repo before using any code. If you want us to add a license somewhere, open an issue
